NODE js

# Node.js Tutorial Project

This project demonstrates the basics of using Node.js as a runtime environment for JavaScript, following the 
[W3Schools Node.js Get Started tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_get_started.asp).

## Features
- **Hello, World!**: A simple example of Node.js execution.
- **Basic Node.js Server**: Setting up and running a server.

## Steps to Run

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nodejs-tutorial.git

### **Some facts for you**
**Modules**: I learned that they allow for organizing code by breaking it into smaller, reusable pieces. Core Node.js modules like fs and http provide built-in functionality. You can also create custom modules and export them using module.exports, and then import them with require(). This modular approach enhances code maintainability and reusability in larger projects.
**HTTP Module**: I learned that it allows the creation of web servers by handling HTTP requests and responses. Using the http module, I can set up a server, manage request methods like GET and POST, and send responses. The module also enables listening on specific ports and routing requests based on URL patterns. This is crucial for building server-side applications with Node.js.
**File System Module**: I learned how to interact with the file system in Node.js. This includes reading, writing, updating, and deleting files using functions like fs.readFile(), fs.writeFile(), and fs.unlink(). I also learned how to work with directories, check if files exist, and monitor file changes. The FS module is essential for handling file operations in server-side applications built with Node.js.
**URL Module**: I learned that it helps in parsing and manipulating URLs in Node.js. The url module allows you to work with parts of a URL like protocol, hostname, pathname, and query parameters. I can use functions like url.parse() and url.format() to parse, format, and resolve relative URLs. This is useful for handling and managing URLs in server-side applications.
**NPM**: I learned that NPM (Node Package Manager) is a vital tool for managing packages in Node.js. It helps in installing, updating, and managing dependencies for Node.js projects. I also discovered how to use npm init to set up a project and npm install to add libraries. The tutorial also covers how to manage packages locally and globally, and how to use the package.json file to track project dependencies.
**Events**: I learned that it allows handling asynchronous events in Node.js. The events module enables the creation of event-driven applications by utilizing an EventEmitter class. I can emit events and bind listeners to them, allowing specific actions when an event occurs. This is key in Node.js for handling multiple tasks efficiently and responding to events like user actions or data changes.
**Upload Files**: I learned how to handle file uploads in Node.js using the multer middleware. This module simplifies receiving files from forms and storing them on the server. It covers how to set up multer, configure storage options, and handle various file formats. Additionally, the tutorial explains how to implement file validation and error handling when users upload files.
**Send an Email**: I learned how to send emails from a Node.js application using the nodemailer package. The tutorial explains setting up nodemailer, configuring SMTP settings, and sending emails with attachments or HTML content. It also covers authentication and error handling to ensure smooth operation when sending emails through various email services.
