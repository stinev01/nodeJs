NODE js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform server environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side.
 It employs asynchronous programming, enabling efficient handling of multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for operations to complete.
 This non-blocking, single-threaded approach makes Node.js memory efficient and well-suited for event-driven applications.
 With built-in modules, developers can perform tasks such as file manipulation, database interactions, and handling HTTP requests.
 Additionally, Node.js can generate dynamic page content and manage form data, making it a versatile tool for server-side development.
