# Node.js Tutorial Project

This project demonstrates the basics of using Node.js as a runtime environment for JavaScript, following the 
[W3Schools Node.js Get Started tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_get_started.asp).

## Features
- **Hello, World!**: A simple example of Node.js execution.
- **Basic Node.js Server**: Setting up and running a server.

## Steps to Run

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nodejs-tutorial.git

### **What This README Covers**
**Project Overview**: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform server environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side.
 It employs asynchronous programming, enabling efficient handling of multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for operations to complete.
 This non-blocking, single-threaded approach makes Node.js memory efficient and well-suited for event-driven applications.
 With built-in modules, developers can perform tasks such as file manipulation, database interactions, and handling HTTP requests.
 Additionally, Node.js can generate dynamic page content and manage form data, making it a versatile tool for server-side development.
